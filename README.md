# AIChatWith App Clean Modular Architecture
A demo iOS project showcasing **Clean, Modular Architecture** using **MVVM**, **VIPER**, and **RIBs**, combined with **protocol-oriented programming** and **dependency injection** for scalability, maintainability, and testability.

## 📐 Architecture Overview

This project is designed with **layered modular architecture** to keep the codebase **clean, scalable, and easy to maintain**.  
It separates **UI, business logic, navigation, and data access** into independent layers.

---

### 🧩 Layers

#### 1. Dependencies & Core Builder
- **CoreBuilder** is the central point for dependency injection.
- Ensures no hard-coded dependencies between modules.
- Makes it easy to swap implementations and unit test modules in isolation.

#### 2. View + Presenter (UI Layer)
- **View**: Renders the UI and handles user input.
- **Presenter**: Mediates between the View and Interactor/Router.
- Communication is via **protocols**, enabling loose coupling.
- UI components are **shared** and reusable across modules.

#### 3. Router Layer
- **Router**: Handles navigation and view attachment/detachment.
- **CoreRouter** coordinates navigation flows across the entire app.
- Follows **RIB** (Router–Interactor–Builder) principles for modular navigation.

#### 4. Interactor Layer
- **Interactor**: Contains business logic and coordinates with Managers.
- **CoreInteractor** holds shared workflows across features.

#### 5. Manager Layer
- **Manager**: Coordinates complex workflows and aggregates results from Services.
- Keeps Interactors focused solely on business rules.

#### 6. Service Layer
- **Service**: Handles API calls, database queries, and system-level operations.
- Each service has a **single responsibility** and returns **Models**.

#### 7. Model Layer
- **Model**: Plain data objects (Entities) used to transfer data between layers.
- Contains **no business logic**.

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **User Action** → View notifies Presenter.  
2. **Presenter** → Passes request to Interactor.  
3. **Interactor** → Uses Manager to trigger a process.  
4. **Manager** → Calls one or more Services.  
5. **Service** → Fetches/updates data and returns Models.  
6. **Presenter** → Formats data for the View.  
7. **View** → Updates UI.

## ✅ Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a focused responsibility.
- **Testability**: Protocols make it easy to mock and test in isolation.
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growing teams and features.
- **Reusability**: Shared UI components, services, and managers.
- **Flexibility**: Can evolve from MVVM → VIPER → RIBs depending on complexity.
